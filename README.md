# NativeUsbLib

[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/NativeUsbLib)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NativeUsbLib/)

This is a port of the excellent .net Usb Library from the sourceforge project [
UsbViewer in C#](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbviewerincsha/) by [nick vetter](https://sourceforge.net/u/nickvetter/profile/). The library has not been updated for quite some time and is targeting .net framework 2.0. There are also issues running on x64 builds of Windows. This repo updates the runtimes and resolves the x64 runtime issues. The library is also available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NativeUsbLib).
